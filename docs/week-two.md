It seemed appropriate to begin a class on marine phytoplankton with what makes phytoplankton distinct from other planktonic organisms: the ability to use light to make new biomass.

Because this is such a complex topic, and so intricately tied to the physics of light, this first session has two papers that are more technical than the breakdown we anticipate in future sessions. We'll start class with a more structured introduction to light acquisition in the phytoplankton.
