It seemed appropriate to begin a class on marine phytoplankton with what makes phytoplankton distinct from other planktonic organisms: the ability to use light to make new biomass.

Because this is such a complex topic, and so intricately tied to the physics of light, this first session has two papers that are more technical than the breakdown we anticipate in future sessions. We'll start class with a more structured introduction to light acquisition in the phytoplankton.

### Paper One: Masuda 2021

### Paper Two: Geider 1987

_Light and Temperature Dependence of the Carbon to Chlorophyll a Ratio in Microalgae and Cyanobacteria: Implications for Physiology and Growth of Phytoplankton_

This is our quantitative paper for the week. This paper has over 600 citations, almost all of which have to do with modeling or description of aquatic photosynthesis.

  <div class="panel-body">
    The carbon:chlorophyll ratio (&theta;) is the essential indicator of microalgal photosynthesis and depends on (1) temperature and (2) photon flux, or how quickly packets of light are reaching each chlorophyll molecule and how warm it is in the ambient environment. <br>
    At low temperatures, the carbon:chlorophyll ratio is higher. This happens irrespective of species/taxonomic group, and indicates that more photosynthetic effort as measured by chlorophyll is required per biomass unit when light is scarce.

One of Geider's objectives was to figure out a good value to use for the carbon to chlorophyll ratio at a given photon flux density (_I_). Geider's finding was that a single value can't adequately represent the range of $\theta$ that is observed, even when photons are constant and the only thing that changes is temperature. More recent research also suggests that the photon flux, in addition to changing the chlorophyll to carbon ratio, may also be involved in deciding the behavior of mixotrophs (e.g. [Ghyoot et al. 2017](https://2021-phyto-phys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/ghyoot2017.pdf). Under high photon flux density, the photoacclimation state of a mixotroph that's being limited by nutrients rather than light could be wonky, because it isn't actively photosynthesizing. But it turns out that even so, the mixotroph might be shuffling regenerated nutrients from the food it's eating to support its own internal photosynthesis. 

Another cool tidbit from a recent external paper is that even when photon flux density changes rapidly under mixing conditions, the chlorophyll to carbon ratio might be remarkably constant ([Brown et al. 2021](https://2021-phyto-phys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/brown2021.pdf)).

#### Some initial discussion questions

- To what extent do you think the sweepingly general findings of the author are due to the species under consideration?
- How can mixotrophy impact the conclusions the author reached?
- What are some ways you might model these relationships?
