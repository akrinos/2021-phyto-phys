# Session 1
## Classical Models & An Introduction to Phytoplankton Physiology

### Classical Models

Because much of this class will be focused on quantitative approaches to assessing phytoplankton physiology and community ecology, we'll start with a discussion of a couple of classical models that have applications far beyond the phytoplankton world. 

#### Lotka-Volterra

Classically known as the predator-prey model, Lotka-Volterra is applicable even to phytoplankton. Papers have been published just this year that leverage classical Lotka-Volterra dynamics to explain phytoplankton ecology.
